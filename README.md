#Project Overview

EngFind is a full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between clients and local engineers. The core mission is to create a streamlined, user-friendly platform where users can easily discover, review, and connect with engineering professionals based on their specific needs and location.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of my skills in modern web development, focusing on building a secure, responsive, and feature-rich application from the ground up. It incorporates user authentication, database management, role-based access control, and a dynamic user interface.


Core Features

    User Authentication: Secure registration and login system. User passwords are hashed for security.

    Role-Based Access Control: The platform distinguishes between standard users and administrators, tailoring the experience and permissions for each.

    Engineer Listings: A dynamic directory of engineers. Users can search, filter (e.g., by specialty, location), and view detailed profiles.

    Review and Rating System: Authenticated users can leave reviews and ratings for engineers they have hired, providing valuable community feedback.

    Admin Panel: A dedicated, protected interface for administrators to manage the platform's content and users.

    Responsive Design: The frontend is built to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
